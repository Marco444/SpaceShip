# SpaceShip
A simple game written in Scala and Processing. The intent of the prooyect, given that it already is a game that works, is to profunsize into my understanding of programming, and Scala, through the coding of different implementations, each with a different goal in mind. 

Method: 
 Being able to apply the following ideas implies knowing them. As a result, I will first learn them, and write them on the Scala 
 document, prior to dealing with them here. It should also be noted that the best would be for the actual coding to be done not much later than the theory was learned, soa s to consolidate the concepts on actual code, rather than reviewing it so as to maintain it. 
   
Drastic Improvements:

    1.*RxJava* (https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) es una libreria en Java bastate popular para reactive programing,
      vas a encontrar mucho hecho con esta libreria a diferencia de Signals. Pero si no me equivoco muchos de los conceptos
      son lo mismo. Si tengo tiempo en algun momento te preparo un ejemplo y te lo mando.

    2.*Implicit Implementation.* The idea here is to do another branch of MVC-Spaceship in which I will improve the code by
    implementing the difficulty of the game based on preferences that will be imported given the choosing of the user. Essentially,
    I will re-write a good deal of thge engines in order to simplify the implementation of new levels of difficulty. Moreover, a
    good part of the arguments of the MovingObject class may well be obliberated with this model.
    
    3.*Pararell Programming* (https://www.artima.com/pins1ed/actors-and-concurrency.html)
    
    4.*ScalaCheck*


Gradual Improvements:
    1.Annotations
    2.Extractors
    3.Subclassing Functions
    4.Currying
